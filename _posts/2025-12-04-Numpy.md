> NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays.  
> It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices
>
> - NumPy aims to provide an array object that is up to 50x faster than traditional Python lists.
> - The array object in NumPy is called `ndarray`, it provides a lot of supporting functions that make working with `ndarray` very easy.

## Import NumPy

``` python
import numpy

arr = numpy.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

print(arr)  # [1 2 3 4 5]
```

or create an alias with the `as` keyword while importing:

```python
import numpy as np

arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

print(arr)  # [1 2 3 4 5]
```

## Creating Arrays
### Create a NumPy ndarray Object
Numpy is used to work with array. The array object is called `ndarray`. We can create a Numpy `ndarray` object by using the `array()` function  

```python
import numpy as np

arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

print(arr)        # [1 2 3 4 5]
print(type(arr))  # <class 'numpy.ndarray'>
```
> To create an `ndarray`, we can pass a list, tuple or any array-like object into the `array()` method, and it will be converted into an `ndarray`:

### Dimensions in Arrays

#### 0-D Arrays
> 0-D arrays, or Scalars, are the elements in an array. Each value in an array is a 0-D array.
{: .prompt-info}

``` python
import numpy as mp

arr = np.array(42)

print(arr)  # 42
```

#### 1-D Arrays

> An array that has 0-D arrays as its elements is called uni-dimensional or 1-D array. These are the most common and basic arrays
{: .prompt-info}

```python
import numpy as np

arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

print(arr)  # [1 2 3 4 5]
```


#### 2-D Arrays

> An array that has 1-D arrays as its elements is called a 2-D array.
{: .prompt-info}

```python
import numpy as np

arr = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])

print(arr)
# [[1 2 3]
#  [4 5 6]]
```

#### 3-D Arrays

> An array that has 2-D arrays (matrices) as its elements is called 3-D array.
{: .prompt-info}

```python
import numpy as np

arr = np.array([[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]])

print(arr)
# [[[1 2 3]
#   [4 5 6]]
#
#  [[1 2 3]
#   [4 5 6]]]
```
#### Check Number of Dimensions
> NumPy Arrays provides the `ndim` attribute that return an integer that tells us how many dimensions the array have
{: .prompt-info}

```python
import numpy as np
 
a = np.array(42)
b = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
c = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
d = np.array([[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]])

print(a.ndim)   # 0
print(b.ndim)   # 1
print(c.ndim)   # 2
print(d.ndim)   # 3
```

#### Higher Dimensional Arrays

> When the array is created, define the number of dimensions by using the `ndmin` argument.
{: .prompt-info}


``` python
import numpy as np

arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4], ndmin=5)

print(arr)    # [[[[[1 2 3 4]]]]]
print('number of dimensions :', arr.ndim)   # number of dimensions : 5
```

## NumPy Array Indexing

> Array indexing is the same as accessing an array element. 
> Access an array element by referring to its index
{: .prompt-info}

``` python
import numpy as np

arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])

print(arr[0])    # 1
```

### Access 2-D Arrays
``` python
import numpy as np

arr = np.array([[1,2,3,4,5], [6,7,8,9,10]])

print('2nd element on 1st row: ', arr[0, 1])    # 2nd element on 1st dim:  2
```

### Access 3-D Arrays
``` python
import numpy as np

arr = np.array([[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], [[7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]]])

print(arr[0, 1, 2])   # 6
```

### Negative Indexing

> Use negative indexing to access an array from the end
{: .prompt-info}

```python
import numpy as np

arr = np.array([[1,2,3,4,5], [6,7,8,9,10]])

print('Last element from 2nd dim: ', arr[1, -1])    # Last element from 2nd dim:  10
```

## NumPy Array Slicing
### Slicing Arrays
Slicing in python means taking elements from one given index to another given index. 
- We pass slice instead of index like this: `[start:end]`.
- We can also define the step, like this: `[start:end:step]`.

> - If we don't pass start its considered 0  
> - If we don't pass end its considered length of array in that dimension  
> - If we don't pass step its considered 1
{: .prompt-tip}

``` python
import numpy as np

arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7])

print(arr[1:5])   # [2 3 4 5]
```
